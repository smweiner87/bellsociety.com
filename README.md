This is a guide on how to update the information on this site. We use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/); please familiarize yourself with the framework if you're planning to perform maintenance. It's a simple system and should take about an hour to get up to speed with if you know the computers.

### To add a new Year's worth of Members:

I will use the example year `2032` (ie; you graduate in 2032) with two members, `Will Jawbs` and `Stephen Gaits`. Hopefully this adds clarity.

1. Add a folder named `2032` to the `_members` folder.
2. Add a folder named `2032` to the `images/members` folder.
3. Copy `_members/2014/index.md` into `_members/2032`. Update the year to `2032`.
4. Add `2032` to the `collections: members: years:` list in `_config.yaml`. It'll make sense when you look.
5. Change the `current_year` in `_config.yaml` to the current year. This one was a toughie.
6. Tell members to add themselves (below).
 - Not sure how to manage github access. This might be an unnecessary pain. You may need to do the brunt of this work yourself. In fact, you almost definitely should.
7. Ring many bells with jubilation.

### To add yourself as a member:

I will use the example `2032` and pretend your name is `Will Jawbs`. Hopefully this adds clarity.

1. In the folder `_members/2032`, add a file called `will_jawbs.md`.
2. Copy the contents of `_members/2014/alex_rattray.md` into it, and delete everything that follows a colon in the stuff at the top (between the `---`'s). Except `layout` and `is_member`. Leave that stuff as is.
3. Replace all those blank slots with your info, dude!
4. If you'd like, add a custom bio down below the lower `---`.
  - It's in Markdown or HTML. You can write Markdown or HTML, right? (If not, just write words and it'll be fine. Or ask a friend. Then it'll definitely be fine).
5. Add a jpeg of your pretty face to `images/members/2032` with a filename of `will_jawbs.jpeg`.
  - The file format must be `.jpeg`, not `.jpg` or `.png` or `.anythingelse`.
  - The file name must otherwise exactly match the `will_jawbs.md` in `_members/year/2032`.
  - (This is because Alex, the original creator, was feeling hacky. You could fix this if you felt like it, but consistency can be nice sometimes.)
6. Ring many bells with jubilation.

### To develop/build/deploy an updated version:

Unfortunately, github-pages doesn't support Jekyll 2.0.3, which we rely on (we make heavy use of Collections, a feature which came in at 2.0, and at time of writing gh-pages only supports 1.5.3 ).

So, we have to deploy "manually". We do this using the method described here: [https://gist.github.com/chrisjacob/825950](https://gist.github.com/chrisjacob/825950). I have scripts to help.

1. The first time you clone this repo, run `bin/setup.py`. You'll need to have run `pip install clint` first.
  - This clones a second copy of the repo into `_site`, checks out the `gh-pages` branch, and deletes the `master` branch from that repo. You write to `master` from above `_site`, and push to `gh-pages` from within `_site`.
2. To build/develop, run `jekyll serve --watch`. Or `jekyll build` or whatever.
3. To deploy, run `bin/deploy.py`.
  - It basically just cd's to `_site` and runs `git push`, to `gh-pages`.
